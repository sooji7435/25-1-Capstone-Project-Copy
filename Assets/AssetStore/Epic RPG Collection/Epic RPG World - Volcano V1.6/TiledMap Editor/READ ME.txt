Lava passage tilesets have two animations

For simplicity, you can just use the 'lava passage' tileset only.

If you want to have a revealing animation (like it was hidden and the passage shows after an event)
then you must use the tileset 'the lava passage revealing anim' on top of the regular lava passage tileset.

**If you are using TiledMap Editor, you'll have this automatic, meaning you just have to draw the regular tileset and
the next one will be placed by the automapping on the layer 'lava passage revealing'
In order to work the automapping for the second tileset, the layer in which you draw is called 'lava passage' and then
the tiles with the revealing animation will be placed on the layer 'lava passage revealing'. You can change these layers by going
to the tileset(.tsx) and changing the layer name target there
